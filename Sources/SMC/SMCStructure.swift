/// This is the predefined struct that must be passed to communicate with the
/// AppleSMC driver. While the driver is closed source, the definition of this
/// struct happened to appear in the Apple PowerManagement project at around
/// version 211, and soon after disappeared. It can be seen in the PrivateLib.c
/// file under pmconfigd. Given that it is C code, this is the closest
/// translation to Swift from a type perspective.
